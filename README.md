# Comp2310-Java: Assignment 2

## Overview
This assignment tasks students with creating a Java program to manage and sort student presentation orders for a graduation seminar based on the frequency of specific letters in their last names. Additionally, students will implement functionalities for automatic email generation and class average calculations.

## Objectives
- **Custom Sorting**: Sort students based on the frequency of each letter in their last names, from 'A' to 'Z'.
- **Email Generation**: Automatically generate email addresses for each student.
- **Class Management**: Calculate and display the average grades for each class.
- **Input/Output Management**: Handle the input of student details and output the sorted list with corresponding grades and averages.

## Requirements
### Data Input
- The number of classes.
- The number of students in each class.
- Student details including first name, last name, ID, and date of birth.

### Functional Requirements
- **Student Class**: Implement a `Student` class with appropriate constructors, setters, and getters.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Develop a sorting algorithm based on the specified letter frequency criteria in last names.
- **Email Creation**: Construct emails using the format: `<first_letter_of_first_name><last_name>@ritaj.birzeit.edu`.
- **Grade and Average Calculation**: Implement methods to enter grades and calculate class averages.

### Methods to Implement
- `calculateAverage()`: Calculates the average grade for each class.
- `printStudentListAndAverage()`: Displays the sorted list of students along with their emails, grades, and the class average.
